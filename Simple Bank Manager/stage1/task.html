<h2>Login Screen</h2>

<p>
    This project will have multiple views and we are going to use
    a single activity pattern, in which the activity will act essentially
    as a fragments holder and the fragment will be responsible for
    creating screens for users to interact with.
</p>

<p>
    To help us with that we will use androidx.navigation libraries, that will
    allow us to manage views through a navigation graph
